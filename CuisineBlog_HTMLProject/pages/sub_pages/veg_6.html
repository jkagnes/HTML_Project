		<h2>Method of Preparation</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Chop the onions, garlic and ginger to fine pieces.</li>
			<li>Heat up 2 tbsp of the oil over medium heat, add the cumin seed, fennel seed and fenugreek seed, fry just until they’re aromatic and starting to pop, which will take about 30 seconds – 1 minute.</li>  
			<li>Add the onions, garlic, ginger and qasuri methi, saute until the onions are translucent and the garlic and ginger are starting to soften.</li>
			<li>As soon as the onions are cooked through and soft, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
			<li>In the bowl of a food processor add the coconut, all remaining dried spices, tamarind with juice and the sauteed onion mixture. Drizzle on 3 tbsp of water and puree the mixture until it forms a thick paste.</li>
			<li>Cut the eggplant into quarters until 1/4 inch from the crown (stem end).</li> 
			<li>Stuff the spice mixture into the center and between the slits, gently pressing it back together into a stuffed oval shape.</li>
			<li>Dissolve any remaining spice mixture into 2 cups of water.</li>  
			<li>In a saucepan heat 2 tbsp of oil, lay the stuffed eggplants down.</li> 
			<li>When the skins darken pour the remaining spice mix and little water and cook in low flame for 20 minutes with the lid closed.</li>
			<li>Take the lid off, turn the eggplants over, and let them cook uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.</li>
			<li>Gently turn the eggplants periodically as they cook, and gravy start to reduce slightly and thicken up as it simmers.</li>
			<li>When done, garnish it with sprinkle of cilantro.</li>
